In this post, we apply lessons from such a model to a topic of timely relevance in economics: job market recommendation letters.

Using insights from our model, we argue that the value of these letters depends on who reads them.",T7

To summarize, growth in 2025 is expected to be stronger than in September due to a lower projected path of the policy rate, as well as higher productivity. Inflation projections are higher in 2025 because of cost-push shocks, which capture the effects of tariffs. The model’s predictions for the short-run real natural rate of interest (or r*) in 2025 have decreased relative to September.",T6

In this post, we let firms speak for themselves about what factors they consider when adjusting prices in response to various shocks. The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T6

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T6
331,"In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/u-s-banks-have-developed-a-significant-nonbank-footprint"">previous post</a>, we documented how, over the past five decades, the typical U.S. bank has evolved from an entity mainly focused on deposit taking and loan making to a more diversified conglomerate also incorporating a variety of nonbank activities. In this post, we show that an important driver of the evolution of this new organizational form is the desire of banks to efficiently manage liquidity needs.<br />",T7
332,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T7

How have these developments affected the functioning of the key U.S. Treasury securities market?

336,"After the Great Financial Crisis, the European Central Bank (ECB) extended its monetary policy toolbox to include the use of long-term loans to banks at interest rates close to zero or even negative. These central bank interventions were aimed at supporting the transmission of expansionary monetary policy and likely played a crucial role in bolstering the financial stability of the euro area, namely by reducing the chance of bank runs. However, quantitative evidence on the effects of these interventions on financial stability remains scant. In this post, we quantify the effectiveness of central bank lending programs in supporting financial stability through the lens of a novel structural model discussed in this <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3708226"">paper</a>.",T7
337,"Every state in the country has a law permitting involuntary hospitalization if a person presents a danger to themselves or others as a result of mental illness.

(The process is also sometimes called involuntary commitment, involuntary psychiatric hold, or sectioning.) Although there is no definitive national accounting, it is estimated that about 1.2 million involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations occur every year (<a href=""https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201900477"">Lee and Cohen 2021</a>).

338,"Uncertainty is a key component of everyday economic decisions of consumers and, perhaps not surprisingly, it plays a central role in economic models. According to economic theory, forward-looking consumers rely on their expectations and perceived uncertainty when making economic decisions. Nevertheless, measuring the uncertainty that households actually perceive, and how it affects consumer behavior, is challenging. The probabilistic nature of the <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Survey of Consumer Expectations</a> enables us to make progress on this subject and to construct household-specific time-varying uncertainty. In our recent <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1148"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Staff Report</a>, we empirically show that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is increasing and concave in perceived uncertainty.
