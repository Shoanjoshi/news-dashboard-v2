355,"Banks must extract useful signals of a potential borrower's quality from a large set of possibly informative characteristics when making lending decisions. A model that speaks to how banks specialize in lending to an industry in order to better extract signals from data, can potentially be applied to a number of real-world scenarios. In this post, we apply lessons from such a model to a topic of timely relevance in economics: job market recommendation letters. Institutions looking to hire new economists must evaluate PhD applicants based on limited and often noisy signals of future performance, including letters of recommendation from these applicants’ advisors or co-authors. Using insights from our model, we argue that the value of these letters depends on who reads them.",T10

To summarize, growth in 2025 is expected to be stronger than in September due to a lower projected path of the policy rate, as well as higher productivity. Inflation projections are higher in 2025 because of cost-push shocks, which capture the effects of tariffs. The model’s predictions for the short-run real natural rate of interest (or r*) in 2025 have decreased relative to September.",T2

359,"There has been a lot of interest in firms’ pricing decisions in the past few years—both during the inflation surge of 2021-23 and in the more recent rounds of tariff increases. In this post, we let firms speak for themselves about what factors they consider when adjusting prices in response to various shocks. The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T1

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T2

362,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T10

We use data through 2025:Q2 for our analysis, and also discuss how the vulnerability measures have changed since our last update <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2024/11/banking-system-vulnerability-2024-update/?_ppp=6960e497ee"">one year ago</a>.",T10
366,"After the Great Financial Crisis, the European Central Bank (ECB) extended its monetary policy toolbox to include the use of long-term loans to banks at interest rates close to zero or even negative. These central bank interventions were aimed at supporting the transmission of expansionary monetary policy and likely played a crucial role in bolstering the financial stability of the euro area, namely by reducing the chance of bank runs. However, quantitative evidence on the effects of these interventions on financial stability remains scant. In this post, we quantify the effectiveness of central bank lending programs in supporting financial stability through the lens of a novel structural model discussed in this <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3708226"">paper</a>.",T10
367,"Every state in the country has a law permitting involuntary hospitalization if a person presents a danger to themselves or others as a result of mental illness. If a person reaches this high bar, the logic goes, they should be confined in a psychiatric hospital for treatment until they are stabilized. (The process is also sometimes called involuntary commitment, involuntary psychiatric hold, or sectioning.) Although there is no definitive national accounting, it is estimated that about 1.2 million involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations occur every year (<a href=""https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201900477"">Lee and Cohen 2021</a>). This puts the magnitude on par with the 1.2 million individuals imprisoned in state, federal, and military prisons every year (<a href=""https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2021-statistical-tables"">Carson 2022</a>). In a new <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1158.html"">Staff Report</a>, we use data from Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, to measure how psychiatric commitments are impacting an individual’s risk of danger to themselves or others, earnings, and housing.",T8
368,"Uncertainty is a key component of everyday economic decisions of consumers and, perhaps not surprisingly, it plays a central role in economic models. According to economic theory, forward-looking consumers rely on their expectations and perceived uncertainty when making economic decisions.

The probabilistic nature of the <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Survey of Consumer Expectations</a> enables us to make progress on this subject and to construct household-specific time-varying uncertainty.

In this post, we extend our trading activity analysis to the full range of Treasury securities and market segments.

405,"<p>※この記事は自動翻訳されています。正確な内容につきましては原文をご参照ください。 要約 北朝鮮のハッカーが2025年に暗号資産を20.2億ドル盗み、前年比51%増加、累計被害総額は67.5億ドルに到達。攻撃件数は減少傾向。 北朝鮮は、IT労働者を暗号資産サービス内部に配置したり、経営層を標的とした高度ななりすまし手法を用いるなど、少ない件数で巨額の盗難を実現している。 北朝鮮は、中国語系のマネーロンダリングサービスやブリッジサービス、ミキシングプロトコルを好んで利用し、大規模な窃盗後は約45日間で資金洗浄を完了させる傾向がある。 2025年、個人ウォレットの侵害は15万8,000件に急増し、被害者は8万人に達したが、被害総額（7億1,300万ドル）は2024年から減少した。 分散型金融（DeFi）における預かり資産（TVL）は増加したが、2024～2025年のハッキング被害額は抑制されており、セキュリティ対策の強化が効果を発揮している可能性が示唆される。 暗号資産エコシステムは2025年も厳しい1年となり、盗難被害額は増加傾向が続きました。当社の分析からは、暗号資産盗難のパターンが変化していることが明らかになり、主な変化は以下の4点です。北朝鮮（DPRK）が依然として最大の脅威であること、中央集権型サービスへの個別攻撃が深刻化していること、個人ウォレットの被害が急増していること、そして分散型金融（DeFi）ハッキングのトレンドが従来と異なる動きを見せていることです。 これらの傾向はデータから明確に読み取れ、さまざまなプラットフォームや被害者層で暗号資産盗難の様相が大きく変化していることが分かります。デジタルアセットの普及が進み、資産価値が新たな高みに到達する中で、進化するセキュリティ脅威を理解することがますます重要となっています。 全体像：2025年に34億ドル以上が盗難被害 2025年1月から12月初旬までの間に、暗号資産業界では34億ドル超の盗難被害が発生しました。そのうち、2月のBybitへの攻撃だけで15億ドルを占めています。 この総額の背後では、盗難の構成にも重要な変化が見られます。個人ウォレットの侵害による被害割合は大きく増加し、2022年の全体の7.3％から2024年には44％に拡大。2025年はBybit事件の影響が大きくなければ37％になっていたと考えられます。 一方、中央集権型サービスでは秘密鍵のハッキングによる巨額損失が発生しています。こうしたプラットフォームは豊富なリソースと専門のセキュリティチームを有していますが、根本的なセキュリティ課題により依然として脆弱です。発生頻度は低いものの（以下のグラフ参照）、一度発生すると規模が非常に大きく、2025年第1四半期の損失の88％を占めました。 盗難被害額が高止まりしていることは、一部",T10
