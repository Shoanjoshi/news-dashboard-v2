The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T1

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T11
331,"In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/u-s-banks-have-developed-a-significant-nonbank-footprint"">previous post</a>, we documented how, over the past five decades, the typical U.S. bank has evolved from an entity mainly focused on deposit taking and loan making to a more diversified conglomerate also incorporating a variety of nonbank activities. In this post, we show that an important driver of the evolution of this new organizational form is the desire of banks to efficiently manage liquidity needs.<br />",T0
332,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T0

336,"After the Great Financial Crisis, the European Central Bank (ECB) extended its monetary policy toolbox to include the use of long-term loans to banks at interest rates close to zero or even negative. These central bank interventions were aimed at supporting the transmission of expansionary monetary policy and likely played a crucial role in bolstering the financial stability of the euro area, namely by reducing the chance of bank runs. However, quantitative evidence on the effects of these interventions on financial stability remains scant. In this post, we quantify the effectiveness of central bank lending programs in supporting financial stability through the lens of a novel structural model discussed in this <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3708226"">paper</a>.",T0
337,"Every state in the country has a law permitting involuntary hospitalization if a person presents a danger to themselves or others as a result of mental illness. If a person reaches this high bar, the logic goes, they should be confined in a psychiatric hospital for treatment until they are stabilized. (The process is also sometimes called involuntary commitment, involuntary psychiatric hold, or sectioning.) Although there is no definitive national accounting, it is estimated that about 1.2 million involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations occur every year (<a href=""https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201900477"">Lee and Cohen 2021</a>). This puts the magnitude on par with the 1.2 million individuals imprisoned in state, federal, and military prisons every year (<a href=""https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2021-statistical-tables"">Carson 2022</a>). In a new <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1158.html"">Staff Report</a>, we use data from Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, to measure how psychiatric commitments are impacting an individual’s risk of danger to themselves or others, earnings, and housing.",T0

341,"The term “exorbitant privilege” emerged in the 1960s to describe the advantages derived by the U.S. economy from the dollar’s status as the de facto global reserve currency. In this post, we examine the exorbitant privilege that accrued to the Netherlands in the eighteenth century, when the Dutch guilder enjoyed global <a href=""https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb16q4a2.pdf"">reserve currency</a> status. We show how the private actions of financial institutions created and maintained this privilege, even in the absence of a central bank. While privilege benefited the Dutch financial system in many ways, it also laid the seeds of later financial crisis.",T12

What stands out are the large differences in realized tariff rates by trading partner, ranging from less than 5 percent for Canada and Mexico to 15 percent for Japan and to 40 percent for China. This post shows that the bulk of cross-country differences in tariff rates is explained by two factors:  the U.S.-Canada-Mexico free trade agreement and differing sales shares in tariff-exempt categories.",T1

Focusing on the jurisdictions that adopted pay transparency laws early on, we find that many employers ignore pay transparency requirements; roughly a quarter of job listings covered by these laws fail to include salary information.",T1

In this post, we investigate how the Federal Reserve’s liquidity support affected investor risk perceptions during the run. We find that the announcement of the Fed’s novel Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), and subsequent borrowings from the program, substantially reduced investor risk perceptions. However, borrowings from the Fed’s traditional discount window (DW) had no such effect.",T0
346,"The bank run that started in March 2023 in the U.S. occurred at an unusually rapid pace, suggesting that depositors were surprised by these events. Given that public data revealed bank vulnerabilities as early as 2022:Q1, were other market participants also surprised? In this post, based on a <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1095"">recent paper</a>, we develop a new, high-frequency measure of bank balance sheet risk to examine how stock market investors’ risk sensitivity evolved around the run. We find that stock market investors only became attentive to bank risk after the run and only to the risk of a limited number (less than one-third) of publicly traded banks. Surprisingly, investors seem to have mostly focused on media exposure and not fundamentals when evaluating bank risk.

These use cases are currently limited to the digital asset ecosystem. However, the recent approval of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the passage of the GENIUS Act raise concerns about the impact of these tokenized investment fund to the broader financial system. In this post, we assess this impact by considering three economic mechanisms based in part on market participants’ investment strategies and liquidity needs. They include: liquidity transformation, interconnections between the digital asset and the traditional financial system, and transaction settlement. Through these mechanisms, tokenization of investment funds can bring about financial stability benefits in the form of reduced redemption pressures and additional sources of liquidity for fund issuances, but may also increase interconnectedness between the traditional financial system and digital asset ecosystem, thereby amplifying existing financial st",T12

Currently 14.45% of Sky supply is locked in the MKR-SKY exchange contract. That puts its valuation at $271 million at $0.054. When there are sudden market shifts, bots will purchase this MKR from exchanges/liquidity pools at a discount, convert it to SKY, then dump it, causing SKY price to decline as the market is flooded. In addition, any day an idle MKR wallet may come online and convert then dump which will post a risk to Sky investors for years to come at the current rate. During the last dump, ETH price declined 5% but Sky price fell almost 10%, pushed on by the bots purchase and then dump of $840k of converted Sky. There are 50 holders of $800k+ of MKR, any one of them can significantly hit our price. Sky needs to act to defend itself within reason.</p>

The Sky website reminds me of the Eth Foundation’s <a href=""https://ethereum.foundation/"">website</a>, it’s beautiful but it’s not made to make money and it’s annoying to use. We need a business-focused website to appeal to customers with 3 main tabs (savings, borrow, sky investors) and obviously the savings tab is open when you visit the website listing products without needing to be scrolled down. And the products listed will be Sky’s and Sky stars. Sky.money should evolve to become the hub people use to access Star products.

<p>Spark recently proposed a strategic investment into Arkis, a protocol and technology infrastructure provider facilitating a unified prime brokerage experience across defi and centralized exchanges. Details of the strategic investment proposal SAEP-04 can be seen <a href=""https://forum.sky.money/t/saep-04-strategic-investment-in-arkis/27378"">here</a>.</p>

431,"<p>The current info.sky.money website does not show the whole picture, while it should be maintained for those wanting a simplified picture, Sky is now shifting to a system that requires us to change how we account for things. A note that this suggestion if accepted will be followed up with a suggested frontend redesigned that focuses both on selling Sky as a company to invest in and advertising Sky/Sky Star products.</p>
<p>One obvious example is our investment in stars. On the books it looks like we spent $100M+ as an expense. But in reality this is more of an investment and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Current financials make Sky look like it’s profitable. But switching to accrual makes us look insanely successful. Our $25M investment in Spark even with some already being given out/sold for USDS via the farm is worth $171.73M. Even if our investments in other Stars have not yet yielded a token, they should be valued on the books as an investment not an expense and thus should not be seen as a negative. Our annual profits for 2025 should be $300M+ instead of the current $130M.</p>

432,"<p>To support Sky Agents that choose to use their assets to accumulate SKY tokens, an upcoming Atlas Edit Proposal will implement a new, temporary mechanism that rewards SKY tokens held in a Sky Agent Subproxy’s with an amount of USDS equivalent to the average staking rate over the preceding month, paid out each Monthly Settlement Cycle.</p>
<p>This is meant to eventually be replaced by a permanent solution that makes it easy for Sky Agents to stake SKY tokens directly from their SubProxies.</p>

433,"<p>In order to simplify Sky, an upcoming planned atlas edit proposal will propose to change how Star Token Rewards work so that 100% of the rewards are distributed to USDS holders, and there are no longer multiple types of SKY staking rewards.</p>
<p>Only SKY&gt;SKY staking rewards will be available in this new approach, but the amount of SKY&gt;SKY rewards will increase because the increased Star Token Rewards on USDS will result in a greater USDS supply, and more net revenue for Sky Protocol, which in turns will drive more SKY burn and SKY token rewards. Assuming the SKY&gt;SPK Stakers move over, this will result in the SKY&gt;SKY staking rewards rate remaining roughly constant.</p>
<p>If the Atlas Edit is implemented, then this change would take effect on all future Stars, and at some point in Q1 or Q2, the change would also be applied to the SKY&gt;SPK and USDS&gt;SPK Token Rewards smart contracts, consolidating all of the SPK into the USDS&gt;SPK Token Rewards.</p>

<li><strong>Allocated Genesis Capital:</strong> The specific funds deployed from Sky Core to Genesis Agents. Its primary purpose is to bootstrap innovation and diversity, but it is <em>subtracted</em> when calculating the protocol’s safety margin.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate Backstop Capital:</strong> The “safety net.” Defined as the total net balance of all Genesis Capital <em>plus</em> the Core Council Buffer <em>minus</em> the Allocated Genesis Capital. This represents the excess capital backing USDS beyond standard collateral.</li>
<li><strong>Genesis Capital Backstop Mechanism:</strong> The specific portion of capital held by agents that Sky can “reclaim” as a last line of defense during a crisis (after SKY token inflation fails but before a USDS haircut).</li>
