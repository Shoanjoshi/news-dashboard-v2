324,"Inflation does not always respond to cost and demand pressures in the same way. When shocks are small, the mapping from costs to prices is roughly proportional—double the shock, double the inflation response. But when the economy is hit by large shocks, this proportionality breaks down. As the recent surge and subsequent decline of global inflation showed, price growth can accelerate—or decelerate—by more than one-for-one relative to the size of the disturbance. Economists refer to this pattern as nonlinear inflation dynamics. In this post, I discuss what these nonlinearities mean, how they relate to the slope of the Phillips curve discussed in a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/02/anatomy-not-autopsy-of-the-phillips-curve"">companion post</a>, and how firm-level data can help us understand the mechanisms behind them.",T4
325,"The relationship between inflation and real economic activity has long been central to debates in macroeconomics and monetary policy. At the core of this debate is the Phillips curve (PC), which measures how strongly inflation reacts to movements in economic conditions. The steepness of this curve matters enormously for monetary policy: if the PC is steeper, inflation rises faster during booms and falls faster in recessions, which entails central banks having to act more forcefully if they want to stabilize inflation around their target. Prior analysis found astonishingly small estimates of the slope of the PC, which suggests that the curve is “flat” (or even dead). In this post, I present evidence from coauthored research showing that, contrary to the conventional view, the Phillips curve is alive and steep, and it captures inflation volatility remarkably well once real marginal cost is used instead of standard real economic activity measures.",T4

328,"It is common for price measures to consider changes in quality. That is, a price index might fall even though listed prices are unchanged because the quality of the item has improved. An adjustment for quality captures the fact that consumers are effectively getting more for the same dollar when product quality rises. In practice, however, it is notoriously difficult to measure quality changes since it requires access to detailed data on all product characteristics that matter to consumers. We offer a novel method to infer quality changes and apply it to U.S. import price indices. When we account for quality improvements in this way, we find that the import price inflation based on official measures has been overstated, revealing that consumers have been getting more from their purchases of imported goods than what standard quality adjustments suggest.",T4

Despite these patterns, we found that the labor force participation of workers with disabilities rose noticeably following the pandemic. A relevant question then is how earnings of workers with disabilities compare with workers without disabilities. In this companion post we investigate differences in weekly earnings for workers with and without disabilities. We find that workers with disabilities earn considerably less than workers without disabilities. Additionally, with few exceptions, their earnings have remained roughly constant in real terms since the pre-pandemic period.",T10

We will also show that although employment rates of people with disabilities are very low, they have risen rapidly during the post-pandemic period, largely because of rising labor force participation. Our results are consistent with an increased prevalence of work from home (WFH) arrangements in the post-COVID period differentially benefiting people with disabilities.",T10

332,"The European Union has been an early adopter of carbon policies, with the introduction of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in 2005. This scheme sets a common price for carbon and is applied to the most polluting manufacturing sectors. By increasing the cost of emissions-intensive production, the system incentivizes firms to decrease their use of fossil fuels. However, as we show in a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-can-undermine-a-carbon-tax/"">companion post</a>, the policy’s impact was moderated by firms increasing their reliance on high-emissions imports. To eliminate this workaround, the EU will expand the ETS to imports in 2026, through the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CBAM will essentially put a tariff on imported goods based on their carbon content. Our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a> provides a quantitative analysis of how the ETS and CBAM affect firms’ supply choice decisions, and the resulting changes in domestic prices and emissions.<br />",T4
333,"Several countries have implemented a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to establish high carbon prices and create a disincentive for the use of fossil fuels. Essentially, the tax encourages firms to substitute toward low carbon emission energy. Costs also rise for firms down the supply chain that use production inputs with high-emission content, so the total impact of a carbon tax can be large. In practice, however, firms also have an incentive to find an offset to a carbon tax. In this post, based on our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a>, we present evidence of one such adaptation strategy. We show that French firms increased their imports of high-emission inputs from suppliers outside the European Union’s cap-and-trade system, known as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), reducing the effectiveness of this approach to cutting carbon emissions—an adaptation strategy that leads to “carbon leakage.” To help stop this leakage, the EU is implementing a ""carbon tariff"" in 2026, which is the topic of a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-is-a-carbon-tariff-and-why-is-the-eu-imposing-one/"">companion po",T4

For policymakers, the lesson is that when an economy has more R&#38;D workers and transformative entrepreneurs, they sustain higher long-run productivity growth.",T10
335,"Each year brings a new set of economic challenges: In 2025, major areas of focus included tariffs and trade tensions, as well as the financial pressures facing younger adults. New York Fed economists contributed insightful research on both topics—and readers took notice. In fact, all five of the year’s most-read posts on <em>Liberty Street Economics</em> analyzed aspects of these issues. Read on to see how the restoration of student loan data to credit reports affected borrowers’ credit scores, whether the costs of a college degree are still worth it, how businesses are responding to higher tariffs, and why the U.S. runs a trade deficit.<br />",T4

A model that speaks to how banks specialize in lending to an industry in order to better extract signals from data can potentially be applied to a number of real-world scenarios. In this post, we apply lessons from such a model to a topic of timely relevance in economics: job market recommendation letters. Institutions looking to hire new economists must evaluate PhD applicants based on limited and often noisy signals of future performance, including letters of recommendation from these applicants’ advisors or co-authors. Using insights from our model, we argue that the value of these letters depends on who reads them.",T6

339,"This post presents an update of the economic forecasts generated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model.

To summarize, growth in 2025 is expected to be stronger than in September due to a lower projected path of the policy rate, as well as higher productivity. Inflation projections are higher in 2025 because of cost-push shocks, which capture the effects of tariffs. The model’s predictions for the short-run real natural rate of interest (or r*) in 2025 have decreased relative to September.",T4

The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T4

375,"<p>※この記事は自動翻訳されています。正確な内容につきましては原文をご参照ください。 要約 主に東南アジアを拠点とする人身売買の疑いがあるサービスへの暗号資産の資金フローは、2025年に85%増加し、特定されたサービス全体で数億ドル規模に達しました。 Telegramベースの「インターナショナルエスコート」サービスは、中国語圏のマネーロンダリングネットワーク（CMLN）や担保プラットフォームと高度に統合されており、トランザクションの約半数が10,000ドルを超えています。 分析により、東南アジアの人身売買組織のグローバルな展開が明らかになり、南北アメリカ、ヨーロッパ、オーストラリアなど各地から多額の暗号資産が流入しています。 児童性的虐待コンテンツ（CSAM）ネットワークはサブスクリプション型モデルへと進化し、サディスティックなオンライン過激主義（SOE）コミュニティとの重複が増加しています。また、米国のインフラを戦略的に利用している点は、高度な運営計画を示唆しています。 現金取引とは異なり、暗号資産が本質的に持つ透明性は、法執行機関やコンプライアンスチームが人身売買の活動を検知、追跡、阻止するための前例のない機会を生み出しています。 暗号資産と人身売買の疑いがある活動の交差は2025年にさらに深刻化し、特定されたサービス全体のトランザクション総額は数億ドルに達し、前年比（YoY）85%の増加となりました。この金額は、これらの犯罪がもたらす人的被害を大幅に過小評価しています。真のコストは、送金された金額ではなく、影響を受けた人々の命で測られるべきものです。 人身売買の疑いがあるサービスへの暗号資産の資金フローの急増は、孤立した現象ではなく、東南アジアを拠点とする詐欺コンパウンド、オンラインカジノやギャンブルサイト、そして主にTelegramを通じて運営される中国語圏のマネーロンダリング（CMLN）および担保ネットワークの成長と密接に連動しています。これらすべてが、グローバルな影響力を持つ急速に拡大する現地の不正エコシステムを形成しています。痕跡を残さない現金取引とは異なり、ブロックチェーン技術の透明性は、これらの活動に対する前例のない可視性を提供し、従来の決済手段では不可能であった検知と阻止のための独自の機会を生み出しています。 当社の分析では、暗号資産を利用した人身売買の疑いがある活動を以下の4つの主要カテゴリに分類して追跡しています。 「インターナショナルエスコート」サービス：人身売買の疑いがあるTelegramベースのサービス 「労働者斡旋」エージェント：詐欺コンパウンドへの誘拐や強制労働を仲介するTelegramベースのサービス 売春ネットワーク：搾取的な性的サービスネットワークの疑いがあるもの 児童性的虐待コンテンツ（CSAM）の販売者：CSAM",T8
