A model that speaks to how banks specialize in lending to an industry in order to better extract signals from data, can potentially be applied to a number of real-world scenarios. In this post, we apply lessons from such a model to a topic of timely relevance in economics: job market recommendation letters.

Using insights from our model, we argue that the value of these letters depends on who reads them.",T12

To summarize, growth in 2025 is expected to be stronger than in September due to a lower projected path of the policy rate, as well as higher productivity. Inflation projections are higher in 2025 because of cost-push shocks, which capture the effects of tariffs. The model’s predictions for the short-run real natural rate of interest (or r*) in 2025 have decreased relative to September.",T3

334,"There has been a lot of interest in firms’ pricing decisions in the past few years—both during the inflation surge of 2021-23 and in the more recent rounds of tariff increases. In this post, we let firms speak for themselves about what factors they consider when adjusting prices in response to various shocks. The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T3

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T3

In this post, we show that an important driver of the evolution of this new organizational form is the desire of banks to efficiently manage liquidity needs.<br />",T12
337,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T12

341,"After the Great Financial Crisis, the European Central Bank (ECB) extended its monetary policy toolbox to include the use of long-term loans to banks at interest rates close to zero or even negative. These central bank interventions were aimed at supporting the transmission of expansionary monetary policy and likely played a crucial role in bolstering the financial stability of the euro area, namely by reducing the chance of bank runs. However, quantitative evidence on the effects of these interventions on financial stability remains scant. In this post, we quantify the effectiveness of central bank lending programs in supporting financial stability through the lens of a novel structural model discussed in this <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3708226"">paper</a>.",T12

343,"Uncertainty is a key component of everyday economic decisions of consumers and, perhaps not surprisingly, it plays a central role in economic models. According to economic theory, forward-looking consumers rely on their expectations and perceived uncertainty when making economic decisions. Nevertheless, measuring the uncertainty that households actually perceive, and how it affects consumer behavior, is challenging. The probabilistic nature of the <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Survey of Consumer Expectations</a> enables us to make progress on this subject and to construct household-specific time-varying uncertainty. In our recent <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1148"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Staff Report</a>, we empirically show that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is increasing and concave in perceived uncertainty.

In this post, we extend our trading activity analysis to the full range of Treasury securities and market segments. We find that trading is even more concentrated on the last trading day of the month for other types of Treasury securities and in the dealer-to-customer segment of the market, with trading volume in off-the-run Treasuries twice as high as on other days, on average.",T5

386,"<p>※この記事は自動翻訳されています。正確な内容につきましては原文をご参照ください。 年初、韓国の大手暗号資産取引所のホットウォレットの一つで異常な出金活動が検知されました。約15分間に数百件のトランザクションが実行され、約₩44.5B KRW（3,300万〜3,500万ドル相当）が抜き取られ、同取引所は全ての出金を停止しました。盗まれたアセットには、USDC、BONK、SOL、ORCA、RAY、PYTH、JUPなどの主要トークンが含まれていました。一方で、同取引所は盗難資金の半分超（₩23B KRW相当のLAYERトークン）を凍結することに成功しましたが、残余は既に回復不能でした。出金のパターンとタイミングを分析すると、本件はスマートコントラクトの不具合や利用者レベルの誤操作ではなく、ホットウォレットの署名フローが侵害されたことに起因すると示唆されます。 本記事では、最近発生した取引所ハッキングの動向を解説し、本件の手口を深掘りするとともに、HexagateのWallet Compromise Detection Kitと GateSigner がどのように早期検知ならびに被害額の最小化に寄与し得たかを示します。 CEXとカストディアンに対する侵害は増加傾向 今回の大手取引所での事案は明確な業界トレンドを反映しています。すなわち、中央集権型取引所（CEX）とカストディアンに対する侵害が増えています。背景には、複雑なクラウド環境で高速かつマルチチェーンの出金システムを運用する難度の上昇があります。取引所やカストディアンは市場でもっとも複雑なオンチェーンの資金フローを担うようになった一方で、堅牢なオンチェーンセキュリティの必要性を過小評価し、後に不十分と判明する対策に依存してしまうケースが少なくありません。 当社はほぼ10年にわたり顧客環境をトラッキングし、Lazarusのような脅威グループの動向を追ってきましたが、明らかな変化があります。攻撃者は、より高い利得と大きく複雑な運用スタックを狙って、カストディアンやCEXを標的にする傾向を強めています。直近のBybit、BTCTurk、SwissBorg、Phemex、そして今回の韓国の取引所に対する攻撃はいずれも同じパターンに当てはまります。すなわち、単一点の侵害で、数百万ドル規模の損失が発生するというものです。 各事案の根本原因は異なります。アカウント乗っ取りにつながるソーシャルエンジニアリング、テックスタック内のサイバーセキュリティ上の不具合、マルウェア、内部不正など多岐にわたります。高度な攻撃者は唯一の弱点を突きます。現実的な前提は「完全防御」ではなく「いずれ何かが破られる」ということです。そして破られたとき、全ては検知と対応の速さにかかっています。強力なリアルタイムの検知と対応はリスクをゼロにはしませ",T5
