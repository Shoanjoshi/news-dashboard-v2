To summarize, growth in 2025 is expected to be stronger than in September due to a lower projected path of the policy rate, as well as higher productivity. Inflation projections are higher in 2025 because of cost-push shocks, which capture the effects of tariffs. The model’s predictions for the short-run real natural rate of interest (or r*) in 2025 have decreased relative to September.",T9

In this post, we let firms speak for themselves about what factors they consider when adjusting prices in response to various shocks. The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T9

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T9

339,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T3

However, quantitative evidence on the effects of these interventions on financial stability remains scant.

If a person reaches this high bar, the logic goes, they should be confined in a psychiatric hospital for treatment until they are stabilized. (The process is also sometimes called involuntary commitment, involuntary psychiatric hold, or sectioning.) Although there is no definitive national accounting, it is estimated that about 1.2 million involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations occur every year (<a href=""https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201900477"">Lee and Cohen 2021</a>). This puts the magnitude on par with the 1.2 million individuals imprisoned in state, federal, and military prisons every year (<a href=""https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2021-statistical-tables"">Carson 2022</a>). In a new <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1158.html"">Staff Report</a>, we use data from Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, to measure how psychiatric commitments are impacting an individual’s risk of danger to themselves or others, earnings, and housing.",T14
345,"Uncertainty is a key component of everyday economic decisions of consumers and, perhaps not surprisingly, it plays a central role in economic models. According to economic theory, forward-looking consumers rely on their expectations and perceived uncertainty when making economic decisions. Nevertheless, measuring the uncertainty that households actually perceive, and how it affects consumer behavior, is challenging. The probabilistic nature of the <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Survey of Consumer Expectations</a> enables us to make progress on this subject and to construct household-specific time-varying uncertainty. In our recent <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1148"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Staff Report</a>, we empirically show that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is increasing and concave in perceived uncertainty.

In this post, we extend our trading activity analysis to the full range of Treasury securities and market segments. We find that trading is even more concentrated on the last trading day of the month for other types of Treasury securities and in the dealer-to-customer segment of the market, with trading volume in off-the-run Treasuries twice as high as on other days, on average.",T12
347,"Recently instituted rule amendments have initiated a large migration of dealer-to-client Treasury repurchase trades to central clearing. To date, the main avenue used to access central clearing is Sponsored Service, a clearing product that has, until now, received little attention. This post highlights the results from <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1140"">a recent Staff Report</a> which presents a deep dive into Sponsored Service.

348,"The term “exorbitant privilege” emerged in the 1960s to describe the advantages derived by the U.S. economy from the dollar’s status as the de facto global reserve currency. In this post, we examine the exorbitant privilege that accrued to the Netherlands in the eighteenth century, when the Dutch guilder enjoyed global <a href=""https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb16q4a2.pdf"">reserve currency</a> status. We show how the private actions of financial institutions created and maintained this privilege, even in the absence of a central bank. While privilege benefited the Dutch financial system in many ways, it also laid the seeds of later financial crisis.",T3

What stands out are the large differences in realized tariff rates by trading partner, ranging from less than 5 percent for Canada and Mexico to 15 percent for Japan and to 40 percent for China. This post shows that the bulk of cross-country differences in tariff rates is explained by two factors:  the U.S.-Canada-Mexico free trade agreement and differing sales shares in tariff-exempt categories.",T5

383,"<p>※この記事は自動翻訳されています。正確な内容につきましては原文をご参照ください。 要約 北朝鮮のハッカーが2025年に暗号資産を20.2億ドル盗み、前年比51%増加、累計被害総額は67.5億ドルに到達。攻撃件数は減少傾向。 北朝鮮は、IT労働者を暗号資産サービス内部に配置したり、経営層を標的とした高度ななりすまし手法を用いるなど、少ない件数で巨額の盗難を実現している。 北朝鮮は、中国語系のマネーロンダリングサービスやブリッジサービス、ミキシングプロトコルを好んで利用し、大規模な窃盗後は約45日間で資金洗浄を完了させる傾向がある。 2025年、個人ウォレットの侵害は15万8,000件に急増し、被害者は8万人に達したが、被害総額（7億1,300万ドル）は2024年から減少した。 分散型金融（DeFi）における預かり資産（TVL）は増加したが、2024～2025年のハッキング被害額は抑制されており、セキュリティ対策の強化が効果を発揮している可能性が示唆される。 暗号資産エコシステムは2025年も厳しい1年となり、盗難被害額は増加傾向が続きました。当社の分析からは、暗号資産盗難のパターンが変化していることが明らかになり、主な変化は以下の4点です。北朝鮮（DPRK）が依然として最大の脅威であること、中央集権型サービスへの個別攻撃が深刻化していること、個人ウォレットの被害が急増していること、そして分散型金融（DeFi）ハッキングのトレンドが従来と異なる動きを見せていることです。 これらの傾向はデータから明確に読み取れ、さまざまなプラットフォームや被害者層で暗号資産盗難の様相が大きく変化していることが分かります。デジタルアセットの普及が進み、資産価値が新たな高みに到達する中で、進化するセキュリティ脅威を理解することがますます重要となっています。 全体像：2025年に34億ドル以上が盗難被害 2025年1月から12月初旬までの間に、暗号資産業界では34億ドル超の盗難被害が発生しました。そのうち、2月のBybitへの攻撃だけで15億ドルを占めています。 この総額の背後では、盗難の構成にも重要な変化が見られます。個人ウォレットの侵害による被害割合は大きく増加し、2022年の全体の7.3％から2024年には44％に拡大。2025年はBybit事件の影響が大きくなければ37％になっていたと考えられます。 一方、中央集権型サービスでは秘密鍵のハッキングによる巨額損失が発生しています。こうしたプラットフォームは豊富なリソースと専門のセキュリティチームを有していますが、根本的なセキュリティ課題により依然として脆弱です。発生頻度は低いものの（以下のグラフ参照）、一度発生すると規模が非常に大きく、2025年第1四半期の損失の88％を占めました。 盗難被害額が高止まりしていることは、一部",T12

388,"<p>※この記事は自動翻訳されています。正確な内容につきましては原文をご参照ください。 年初、韓国の大手暗号資産取引所のホットウォレットの一つで異常な出金活動が検知されました。約15分間に数百件のトランザクションが実行され、約₩44.5B KRW（3,300万〜3,500万ドル相当）が抜き取られ、同取引所は全ての出金を停止しました。盗まれたアセットには、USDC、BONK、SOL、ORCA、RAY、PYTH、JUPなどの主要トークンが含まれていました。一方で、同取引所は盗難資金の半分超（₩23B KRW相当のLAYERトークン）を凍結することに成功しましたが、残余は既に回復不能でした。出金のパターンとタイミングを分析すると、本件はスマートコントラクトの不具合や利用者レベルの誤操作ではなく、ホットウォレットの署名フローが侵害されたことに起因すると示唆されます。 本記事では、最近発生した取引所ハッキングの動向を解説し、本件の手口を深掘りするとともに、HexagateのWallet Compromise Detection Kitと GateSigner がどのように早期検知ならびに被害額の最小化に寄与し得たかを示します。 CEXとカストディアンに対する侵害は増加傾向 今回の大手取引所での事案は明確な業界トレンドを反映しています。すなわち、中央集権型取引所（CEX）とカストディアンに対する侵害が増えています。背景には、複雑なクラウド環境で高速かつマルチチェーンの出金システムを運用する難度の上昇があります。取引所やカストディアンは市場でもっとも複雑なオンチェーンの資金フローを担うようになった一方で、堅牢なオンチェーンセキュリティの必要性を過小評価し、後に不十分と判明する対策に依存してしまうケースが少なくありません。 当社はほぼ10年にわたり顧客環境をトラッキングし、Lazarusのような脅威グループの動向を追ってきましたが、明らかな変化があります。攻撃者は、より高い利得と大きく複雑な運用スタックを狙って、カストディアンやCEXを標的にする傾向を強めています。直近のBybit、BTCTurk、SwissBorg、Phemex、そして今回の韓国の取引所に対する攻撃はいずれも同じパターンに当てはまります。すなわち、単一点の侵害で、数百万ドル規模の損失が発生するというものです。 各事案の根本原因は異なります。アカウント乗っ取りにつながるソーシャルエンジニアリング、テックスタック内のサイバーセキュリティ上の不具合、マルウェア、内部不正など多岐にわたります。高度な攻撃者は唯一の弱点を突きます。現実的な前提は「完全防御」ではなく「いずれ何かが破られる」ということです。そして破られたとき、全ては検知と対応の速さにかかっています。強力なリアルタイムの検知と対応はリスクをゼロにはしませ",T12
