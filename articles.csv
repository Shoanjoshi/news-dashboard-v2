The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T1

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T14
337,"In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/u-s-banks-have-developed-a-significant-nonbank-footprint"">previous post</a>, we documented how, over the past five decades, the typical U.S. bank has evolved from an entity mainly focused on deposit taking and loan making to a more diversified conglomerate also incorporating a variety of nonbank activities. In this post, we show that an important driver of the evolution of this new organizational form is the desire of banks to efficiently manage liquidity needs.<br />",T4
338,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T4

342,"After the Great Financial Crisis, the European Central Bank (ECB) extended its monetary policy toolbox to include the use of long-term loans to banks at interest rates close to zero or even negative. These central bank interventions were aimed at supporting the transmission of expansionary monetary policy and likely played a crucial role in bolstering the financial stability of the euro area, namely by reducing the chance of bank runs. However, quantitative evidence on the effects of these interventions on financial stability remains scant. In this post, we quantify the effectiveness of central bank lending programs in supporting financial stability through the lens of a novel structural model discussed in this <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3708226"">paper</a>.",T4
343,"Every state in the country has a law permitting involuntary hospitalization if a person presents a danger to themselves or others as a result of mental illness. If a person reaches this high bar, the logic goes, they should be confined in a psychiatric hospital for treatment until they are stabilized. (The process is also sometimes called involuntary commitment, involuntary psychiatric hold, or sectioning.) Although there is no definitive national accounting, it is estimated that about 1.2 million involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations occur every year (<a href=""https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201900477"">Lee and Cohen 2021</a>). This puts the magnitude on par with the 1.2 million individuals imprisoned in state, federal, and military prisons every year (<a href=""https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2021-statistical-tables"">Carson 2022</a>). In a new <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1158.html"">Staff Report</a>, we use data from Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, to measure how psychiatric commitments are impacting an individual’s risk of danger to themselves or others, earnings, and housing.",T7
344,"Uncertainty is a key component of everyday economic decisions of consumers and, perhaps not surprisingly, it plays a central role in economic models.

In this post, we extend our trading activity analysis to the full range of Treasury securities and market segments. We find that trading is even more concentrated on the last trading day of the month for other types of Treasury securities and in the dealer-to-customer segment of the market, with trading volume in off-the-run Treasuries twice as high as on other days, on average.",T5
346,"Recently instituted rule amendments have initiated a large migration of dealer-to-client Treasury repurchase trades to central clearing. To date, the main avenue used to access central clearing is Sponsored Service, a clearing product that has, until now, received little attention. This post highlights the results from <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1140"">a recent Staff Report</a> which presents a deep dive into Sponsored Service. Here, we summarize the description of the institutional details of this service and its costs and benefits.

347,"The term “exorbitant privilege” emerged in the 1960s to describe the advantages derived by the U.S. economy from the dollar’s status as the de facto global reserve currency. In this post, we examine the exorbitant privilege that accrued to the Netherlands in the eighteenth century, when the Dutch guilder enjoyed global <a href=""https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb16q4a2.pdf"">reserve currency</a> status. We show how the private actions of financial institutions created and maintained this privilege, even in the absence of a central bank. While privilege benefited the Dutch financial system in many ways, it also laid the seeds of later financial crisis.",T5
348,"U.S. trade policy remains in flux. Nevertheless, important elements of the new policy regime are apparent in data through July. What stands out are the large differences in realized tariff rates by trading partner, ranging from less than 5 percent for Canada and Mexico to 15 percent for Japan and to 40 percent for China. This post shows that the bulk of cross-country differences in tariff rates is explained by two factors:  the U.S.-Canada-Mexico free trade agreement and differing sales shares in tariff-exempt categories.",T2
349,"Over the past few months, New Jersey and Vermont have joined a growing number of U.S. states in requiring employers to include an estimated salary range in their online job listings.

Focusing on the jurisdictions that adopted pay transparency laws early on, we find that many employers ignore pay transparency requirements; roughly a quarter of job listings covered by these laws fail to include salary information.",T1

In July 2025, Congress passed the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” (GENIUS) Act, establishing the first comprehensive federal framework governing the issuance of stablecoins.

In this post, we investigate how the Federal Reserve’s liquidity support affected investor risk perceptions during the run. We find that the announcement of the Fed’s novel Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), and subsequent borrowings from the program, substantially reduced investor risk perceptions. However, borrowings from the Fed’s traditional discount window (DW) had no such effect.",T4
352,"The bank run that started in March 2023 in the U.S. occurred at an unusually rapid pace, suggesting that depositors were surprised by these events. Given that public data revealed bank vulnerabilities as early as 2022:Q1, were other market participants also surprised? In this post, based on a <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1095"">recent paper</a>, we develop a new, high-frequency measure of bank balance sheet risk to examine how stock market investors’ risk sensitivity evolved around the run. We find that stock market investors only became attentive to bank risk after the run and only to the risk of a limited number (less than one-third) of publicly traded banks. Surprisingly, investors seem to have mostly focused on media exposure and not fundamentals when evaluating bank risk.

These use cases are currently limited to the digital asset ecosystem. However, the recent approval of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the passage of the GENIUS Act raise concerns about the impact of these tokenized investment fund to the broader financial system. In this post, we assess this impact by considering three economic mechanisms based in part on market participants’ investment strategies and liquidity needs. They include: liquidity transformation, interconnections between the digital asset and the traditional financial system, and transaction settlement. Through these mechanisms, tokenization of investment funds can bring about financial stability benefits in the form of reduced redemption pressures and additional sources of liquidity for fund issuances, but may also increase interconnectedness between the traditional financial system and digital asset ecosystem, thereby amplifying existing financial st",T5

Currently 14.45% of Sky supply is locked in the MKR-SKY exchange contract. That puts its valuation at $271 million at $0.054. When there are sudden market shifts, bots will purchase this MKR from exchanges/liquidity pools at a discount, convert it to SKY, then dump it, causing SKY price to decline as the market is flooded. In addition, any day an idle MKR wallet may come online and convert then dump which will post a risk to Sky investors for years to come at the current rate. During the last dump, ETH price declined 5% but Sky price fell almost 10%, pushed on by the bots purchase and then dump of $840k of converted Sky. There are 50 holders of $800k+ of MKR, any one of them can significantly hit our price. Sky needs to act to defend itself within reason.</p>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://sky-atlas.io/#A.4.1.2.1.1.1.1"">article A.4.1.2.1.1.1.1</a>,  the Delayed Upgrade Penalty for the MKR to SKY conversion contract was set to 1% in the September 18, 2025 Executive Vote. The Delayed Upgrade Penalty will be increased gradually at the rate of 1 percentage point per 3 months thereafter.</p>
<p>Given that the December 11th Spell is the closest we can approximate the 3-month period before increasing the Delayed Upgrade Penalty, we will be including an action to increase the penalty to 2% in the spell contents.

<p>Realistically the current website is pretty but full of fluff and requires a lot of scrolling. The Sky website reminds me of the Eth Foundation’s <a href=""https://ethereum.foundation/"">website</a>, it’s beautiful but it’s not made to make money and it’s annoying to use. We need a business-focused website to appeal to customers with 3 main tabs (savings, borrow, sky investors) and obviously the savings tab is open when you visit the website listing products without needing to be scrolled down. And the products listed will be Sky’s and Sky stars. Sky.money should evolve to become the hub people use to access Star products. There’s a reason the Spark website is so much more popular than the Sky one. Do not put products on",T12

A note that this suggestion if accepted will be followed up with a suggested frontend redesigned that focuses both on selling Sky as a company to invest in and advertising Sky/Sky Star products.</p>
<p>One obvious example is our investment in stars. On the books it looks like we spent $100M+ as an expense. But in reality this is more of an investment and should be treated as such.</p>

Our $25M investment in Spark even with some already being given out/sold for USDS via the farm is worth $171.73M. Even if our investments in other Stars have not yet yielded a token, they should be valued on the books as an investment not an expense and thus should not be seen as a negative.

437,"<p>In order to simplify Sky, an upcoming planned atlas edit proposal will propose to change how Star Token Rewards work so that 100% of the rewards are distributed to USDS holders, and there are no longer multiple types of SKY staking rewards.</p>
<p>Only SKY&gt;SKY staking rewards will be available in this new approach, but the amount of SKY&gt;SKY rewards will increase because the increased Star Token Rewards on USDS will result in a greater USDS supply, and more net revenue for Sky Protocol, which in turns will drive more SKY burn and SKY token rewards. Assuming the SKY&gt;SPK Stakers move over, this will result in the SKY&gt;SKY staking rewards rate remaining roughly constant.</p>
<p>If the Atlas Edit is implemented, then this change would take effect on all future Stars, and at some point in Q1 or Q2, the change would also be applied to the SKY&gt;SPK and USDS&gt;SPK Token Rewards smart contracts, consolidating all of the SPK into the USDS&gt;SPK Token Rewards.</p>

<p>This document outlines advanced long term features of how Sky Ecosystem handles the income generated from the Sky Protocol and Sky Agent Framework Primitives, designed to be future proofed so that Sky can remain as stable and immutable as possible over the long term with minimal need for future governance changes beyond the security, risk and governance maintenance needs carried out by the Core Council.</p>
<p>The Sky TMF is described in this post in order to illustrate the intended long term plan that will be brought to a future Atlas Edit Proposal, in order to form the basis of long term financial performance forecasts for the Sky Ecosystem. In practice the proposals that will implement them could differ slightly from the exact details here, and there are various components and features that may be introduced sequentially, but generally they are expected reflect the overall rules and example scenarios described in this post.</p>
