330,"This post presents an update of the economic forecasts generated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. We describe very briefly our forecast and its change since <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/09/the-new-york-fed-dsge-model-forecast-september-2025/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">September 2025</a>. To summarize, growth in 2025 is expected to be stronger than in September due to a lower projected path of the policy rate, as well as higher productivity. Inflation projections are higher in 2025 because of cost-push shocks, which capture the effects of tariffs. The model’s predictions for the short-run real natural rate of interest (or r*) in 2025 have decreased relative to September.",T8
331,"Following the recent passage of <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">legislation in the U.S.</a>, payment stablecoins seem to be on the brink of wider-scale adoption and explosive growth in market capitalization. In this post, we contend that the driving factor is not their proximity to digital cash instruments, but rather how they are transferred—via global, open-access, peer-to-peer systems, or “permissionless blockchains,” for short.",T1
332,"There has been a lot of interest in firms’ pricing decisions in the past few years—both during the inflation surge of 2021-23 and in the more recent rounds of tariff increases. In this post, we let firms speak for themselves about what factors they consider when adjusting prices in response to various shocks. The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T3

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T8
334,"In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/u-s-banks-have-developed-a-significant-nonbank-footprint"">previous post</a>, we documented how, over the past five decades, the typical U.S. bank has evolved from an entity mainly focused on deposit taking and loan making to a more diversified conglomerate also incorporating a variety of nonbank activities. In this post, we show that an important driver of the evolution of this new organizational form is the desire of banks to efficiently manage liquidity needs.<br />",T4
335,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T4
336,"In 2025, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, trade policy has shifted abruptly, and economic policy uncertainty has increased. How have these developments affected the functioning of the key U.S. Treasury securities market? In this post, we return to some familiar metrics to assess the recent behavior of Treasury market liquidity. We find that liquidity briefly worsened around the April 2025 tariff announcements but that its relation to Treasury volatility has been similar to what it was in the past.",T3
337,"Bank failures and distress can be costly to the economy, causing losses to creditors and reducing the flow of credit and other financial intermediation services. Thus, there is significant value in being able to identify “at risk” banks in a timely and accurate way. In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/09/economic-capital-a-new-measure-of-bank-solvency/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">previous post</a>, we presented a new solvency metric, Economic Capital, and showed how solvency risks in the U.S. banking industry have evolved over time according to this measure. In this post, we continue to draw on our recent <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1144.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Staff Report</a> to present analysis showing that Economic Capital identifies failing banks earlier and more accurately than more conventional solvency measures.",T4
338,"As in previous years, we provide in this post an update on the vulnerability of the U.S. banking system based on four analytical models that capture different aspects of this vulnerability. We use data through 2025:Q2 for our analysis, and also discuss how the vulnerability measures have changed since our last update <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2024/11/banking-system-vulnerability-2024-update/?_ppp=6960e497ee"">one year ago</a>.",T4
339,"After the Great Financial Crisis, the European Central Bank (ECB) extended its monetary policy toolbox to include the use of long-term loans to banks at interest rates close to zero or even negative. These central bank interventions were aimed at supporting the transmission of expansionary monetary policy and likely played a crucial role in bolstering the financial stability of the euro area, namely by reducing the chance of bank runs. However, quantitative evidence on the effects of these interventions on financial stability remains scant. In this post, we quantify the effectiveness of central bank lending programs in supporting financial stability through the lens of a novel structural model discussed in this <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3708226"">paper</a>.",T4
340,"Every state in the country has a law permitting involuntary hospitalization if a person presents a danger to themselves or others as a result of mental illness. If a person reaches this high bar, the logic goes, they should be confined in a psychiatric hospital for treatment until they are stabilized. (The process is also sometimes called involuntary commitment, involuntary psychiatric hold, or sectioning.) Although there is no definitive national accounting, it is estimated that about 1.2 million involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations occur every year (<a href=""https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.201900477"">Lee and Cohen 2021</a>). This puts the magnitude on par with the 1.2 million individuals imprisoned in state, federal, and military prisons every year (<a href=""https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2021-statistical-tables"">Carson 2022</a>). In a new <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1158.html"">Staff Report</a>, we use data from Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, to measure how psychiatric commitments are impacting an individual’s risk of danger to themselves or others, earnings, and housing.",T4
341,"Uncertainty is a key component of everyday economic decisions of consumers and, perhaps not surprisingly, it plays a central role in economic models. According to economic theory, forward-looking consumers rely on their expectations and perceived uncertainty when making economic decisions. Nevertheless, measuring the uncertainty that households actually perceive, and how it affects consumer behavior, is challenging. The probabilistic nature of the <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Survey of Consumer Expectations</a> enables us to make progress on this subject and to construct household-specific time-varying uncertainty. In our recent <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1148"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Staff Report</a>, we empirically show that the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is increasing and concave in perceived uncertainty.

We find that trading is even more concentrated on the last trading day of the month for other types of Treasury securities and in the dealer-to-customer segment of the market, with trading volume in off-the-run Treasuries twice as high as on other days, on average.",T3
343,"Recently instituted rule amendments have initiated a large migration of dealer-to-client Treasury repurchase trades to central clearing. To date, the main avenue used to access central clearing is Sponsored Service, a clearing product that has, until now, received little attention. This post highlights the results from <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1140"">a recent Staff Report</a> which presents a deep dive into Sponsored Service. Here, we summarize the description of the institutional details of this service and its costs and benefits. We then document some basic facts on how market participants use this service, based on confidential data.",T11
344,"The term “exorbitant privilege” emerged in the 1960s to describe the advantages derived by the U.S. economy from the dollar’s status as the de facto global reserve currency. In this post, we examine the exorbitant privilege that accrued to the Netherlands in the eighteenth century, when the Dutch guilder enjoyed global <a href=""https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb16q4a2.pdf"">reserve currency</a> status. We show how the private actions of financial institutions created and maintained this privilege, even in the absence of a central bank. While privilege benefited the Dutch financial system in many ways, it also laid the seeds of later financial crisis.",T4
345,"U.S. trade policy remains in flux. Nevertheless, important elements of the new policy regime are apparent in data through July. What stands out are the large differences in realized tariff rates by trading partner, ranging from less than 5 percent for Canada and Mexico to 15 percent for Japan and to 40 percent for China. This post shows that the bulk of cross-country differences in tariff rates is explained by two factors:  the U.S.-Canada-Mexico free trade agreement and differing sales shares in tariff-exempt categories.",T6
346,"Over the past few months, New Jersey and Vermont have joined a growing number of U.S. states in requiring employers to include an estimated salary range in their online job listings. Has this push for greater pay transparency been effective? In this post, we use granular data on U.S. job postings from Lightcast to assess employers’ compliance with these new regulations. Focusing on the jurisdictions that adopted pay transparency laws early on, we find that many employers ignore pay transparency requirements; roughly a quarter of job listings covered by these laws fail to include salary information.",T8
347,"Digital currencies have grown rapidly in recent years. In July 2025, Congress passed the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” (GENIUS) Act, establishing the first comprehensive federal framework governing the issuance of stablecoins. In this post, we place stablecoins in a historical perspective by comparing them to national bank notes, a form of privately issued money that circulated in the United States from 1863 through 1935.",T1
348,"In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/09/reading-the-panic-how-investors-perceived-bank-risk-during-the-2023-bank-run/"">companion post</a>, we showed that during the bank run of spring 2023 investors were seemingly not concerned about bank risk broadly but rather became sensitized to the risk of only about a third of all publicly traded banks. In this post, we investigate how the Federal Reserve’s liquidity support affected investor risk perceptions during the run. We find that the announcement of the Fed’s novel Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), and subsequent borrowings from the program, substantially reduced investor risk perceptions. However, borrowings from the Fed’s traditional discount window (DW) had no such effect.",T4
349,"The bank run that started in March 2023 in the U.S. occurred at an unusually rapid pace, suggesting that depositors were surprised by these events. Given that public data revealed bank vulnerabilities as early as 2022:Q1, were other market participants also surprised? In this post, based on a <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1095"">recent paper</a>, we develop a new, high-frequency measure of bank balance sheet risk to examine how stock market investors’ risk sensitivity evolved around the run. We find that stock market investors only became attentive to bank risk after the run and only to the risk of a limited number (less than one-third) of publicly traded banks. Surprisingly, investors seem to have mostly focused on media exposure and not fundamentals when evaluating bank risk. In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/09/calming-the-panic-investor-risk-perceptions-and-the-feds-emergency-lending-during-the-2023-bank-run/"">companion post</a>, we examine how the Federal Reserve’s liquidity support affected investor risk perceptions.",T4
