328,"It is common for price measures to consider changes in quality. That is, a price index might fall even though listed prices are unchanged because the quality of the item has improved. An adjustment for quality captures the fact that consumers are effectively getting more for the same dollar when product quality rises. In practice, however, it is notoriously difficult to measure quality changes since it requires access to detailed data on all product characteristics that matter to consumers. We offer a novel method to infer quality changes and apply it to U.S. import price indices. When we account for quality improvements in this way, we find that the import price inflation based on official measures has been overstated, revealing that consumers have been getting more from their purchases of imported goods than what standard quality adjustments suggest.",T0

Despite these patterns, we found that the labor force participation of workers with disabilities rose noticeably following the pandemic. A relevant question then is how earnings of workers with disabilities compare with workers without disabilities. In this companion post we investigate differences in weekly earnings for workers with and without disabilities. We find that workers with disabilities earn considerably less than workers without disabilities. Additionally, with few exceptions, their earnings have remained roughly constant in real terms since the pre-pandemic period.",T0

In this set of companion posts, we will examine how prime-aged workers with disabilities have fared in the labor market compared to the year prior to the pandemic. In this first post, we will show that people with disabilities are far less likely to be employed than people without disabilities, with both lower labor force participation and higher unemployment playing a role. We will also show that although employment rates of people with disabilities are very low, they have risen rapidly during the post-pandemic period, largely because of rising labor force participation. Our results are consistent with an increased prevalence of work from home (WFH) arrangements in the post-COVID period differentially benefiting people with disabilities.",T0

In this post, we update our index through 2025 and show that it also <em>forecasts</em> future wage inflation best both in and out of sample. In addition, we highlight availability of the index as a <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/labor-market-tightness"">new regularly updated feature</a> on the New York Fed's website.",T0
332,"The European Union has been an early adopter of carbon policies, with the introduction of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in 2005. This scheme sets a common price for carbon and is applied to the most polluting manufacturing sectors. By increasing the cost of emissions-intensive production, the system incentivizes firms to decrease their use of fossil fuels. However, as we show in a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-can-undermine-a-carbon-tax/"">companion post</a>, the policy’s impact was moderated by firms increasing their reliance on high-emissions imports. To eliminate this workaround, the EU will expand the ETS to imports in 2026, through the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CBAM will essentially put a tariff on imported goods based on their carbon content. Our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a> provides a quantitative analysis of how the ETS and CBAM affect firms’ supply choice decisions, and the resulting changes in domestic prices and emissions.<br />",T3
333,"Several countries have implemented a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to establish high carbon prices and create a disincentive for the use of fossil fuels. Essentially, the tax encourages firms to substitute toward low carbon emission energy. Costs also rise for firms down the supply chain that use production inputs with high-emission content, so the total impact of a carbon tax can be large. In practice, however, firms also have an incentive to find an offset to a carbon tax. In this post, based on our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a>, we present evidence of one such adaptation strategy. We show that French firms increased their imports of high-emission inputs from suppliers outside the European Union’s cap-and-trade system, known as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), reducing the effectiveness of this approach to cutting carbon emissions—an adaptation strategy that leads to “carbon leakage.” To help stop this leakage, the EU is implementing a ""carbon tariff"" in 2026, which is the topic of a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-is-a-carbon-tariff-and-why-is-the-eu-imposing-one/"">companion po",T3

The data support the idea of productivity growth being driven by the symbiotic relationship between transformative entrepreneurs and R&#38;D workers. For policymakers, the lesson is that when an economy has more R&#38;D workers and transformative entrepreneurs, they sustain higher long-run productivity growth.",T0

Using insights from our model, we argue that the value of these letters depends on who reads them.",T6

To summarize, growth in 2025 is expected to be stronger than in September due to a lower projected path of the policy rate, as well as higher productivity.

The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T0

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T0
343,"In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/u-s-banks-have-developed-a-significant-nonbank-footprint"">previous post</a>, we documented how, over the past five decades, the typical U.S. bank has evolved from an entity mainly focused on deposit taking and loan making to a more diversified conglomerate also incorporating a variety of nonbank activities. In this post, we show that an important driver of the evolution of this new organizational form is the desire of banks to efficiently manage liquidity needs.<br />",T6
344,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T6

383,"<p>※この記事は自動翻訳されています。正確な内容につきましては原文をご参照ください。 2025年、暗号資産分野で国家主導の活動が顕著に増加し、不正なオンチェーン・エコシステム成熟の新たな段階を迎えました。ここ数年で暗号資産犯罪の状況はますますプロフェッショナル化しており、不正組織は現在、国際的な犯罪ネットワークが商品やサービスを調達し、不正に得た暗号資産を洗浄するための大規模なオンチェーンインフラを運営しています。こうした状況を背景に、国家も同じプロフェッショナルなサービス事業者を利用したり、制裁回避のために独自インフラを構築したりして、この領域へ参入しています。サイバー犯罪者や組織犯罪グループ向けに構築された不正な暗号資産サプライチェーンに国家が加わることで、行政機関やコンプライアンス・セキュリティチームは、消費者保護と国家安全保障の両面でこれまでになく重大なリスクに直面しています。 これらの現象やその他の動向はオンチェーン上でどのように表れているのでしょうか？データと全体的なトレンドを見ていきましょう。 当社のデータによると、不正な暗号資産アドレスが2025年に受け取った金額は少なくとも1,540億ドルに達しました。これは前年比で162%の増加であり、主に制裁対象となった主体が受け取った金額の694%という劇的な増加が要因です。仮に制裁対象の受領額が前年と同水準だった場合でも、2025年は暗号資産犯罪の記録的な年となるほど、ほぼ全ての不正カテゴリで活動が増加しました。この数字は、現時点で特定できている不正アドレスに基づいた下限値であることを必ずご留意ください。[1] これら不正取引量は、依然として暗号資産経済全体（主に正規取引）と比べて小規模です。全暗号資産取引量に占める不正取引の割合は2024年からわずかに増加しましたが、1%未満にとどまっています。[2] また、暗号資産犯罪で利用されるアセットの種類にも継続的な変化が見られます。下図のチャートをご参照ください。 ここ数年、ステーブルコインが不正取引の大半を占めており、現在では不正取引ボリューム全体の84%を占めています。これは、ステーブルコインが持つ実用的な利点（国境を越えた送金の容易さ、低いボラティリティ、広い用途）により、暗号資産エコシステム全体でも利用が拡大しているトレンドと一致しています。 以下では、2025年の暗号資産犯罪を特徴づけ、今後も注目すべき4つの主要トレンドを詳しく見ていきます。 国家主導型脅威による過去最高の取引量：北朝鮮による過去最大規模の窃盗、ロシアのA7A5トークンによる大規模制裁回避 2025年も盗難資金はエコシステムにとって大きな脅威であり、北朝鮮関連のハッカーだけで20億ドルを盗み出しました。特に2月のBybitへの攻撃は、暗号資産史上最大のデジタル強奪事件となり、",T10
