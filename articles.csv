Despite these patterns, we found that the labor force participation of workers with disabilities rose noticeably following the pandemic. A relevant question then is how earnings of workers with disabilities compare with workers without disabilities. In this companion post we investigate differences in weekly earnings for workers with and without disabilities. We find that workers with disabilities earn considerably less than workers without disabilities. Additionally, with few exceptions, their earnings have remained roughly constant in real terms since the pre-pandemic period.",T2

We will also show that although employment rates of people with disabilities are very low, they have risen rapidly during the post-pandemic period, largely because of rising labor force participation. Our results are consistent with an increased prevalence of work from home (WFH) arrangements in the post-COVID period differentially benefiting people with disabilities.",T2

342,"The European Union has been an early adopter of carbon policies, with the introduction of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in 2005. This scheme sets a common price for carbon and is applied to the most polluting manufacturing sectors. By increasing the cost of emissions-intensive production, the system incentivizes firms to decrease their use of fossil fuels. However, as we show in a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-can-undermine-a-carbon-tax/"">companion post</a>, the policy’s impact was moderated by firms increasing their reliance on high-emissions imports. To eliminate this workaround, the EU will expand the ETS to imports in 2026, through the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CBAM will essentially put a tariff on imported goods based on their carbon content. Our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a> provides a quantitative analysis of how the ETS and CBAM affect firms’ supply choice decisions, and the resulting changes in domestic prices and emissions.<br />",T7
343,"Several countries have implemented a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to establish high carbon prices and create a disincentive for the use of fossil fuels. Essentially, the tax encourages firms to substitute toward low carbon emission energy. Costs also rise for firms down the supply chain that use production inputs with high-emission content, so the total impact of a carbon tax can be large. In practice, however, firms also have an incentive to find an offset to a carbon tax. In this post, based on our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a>, we present evidence of one such adaptation strategy. We show that French firms increased their imports of high-emission inputs from suppliers outside the European Union’s cap-and-trade system, known as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), reducing the effectiveness of this approach to cutting carbon emissions—an adaptation strategy that leads to “carbon leakage.” To help stop this leakage, the EU is implementing a ""carbon tariff"" in 2026, which is the topic of a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-is-a-carbon-tariff-and-why-is-the-eu-imposing-one/"">companion po",T7

To summarize, growth in 2025 is expected to be stronger than in September due to a lower projected path of the policy rate, as well as higher productivity. Inflation projections are higher in 2025 because of cost-push shocks, which capture the effects of tariffs. The model’s predictions for the short-run real natural rate of interest (or r*) in 2025 have decreased relative to September.",T2
350,"Following the recent passage of <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1582"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">legislation in the U.S.</a>, payment stablecoins seem to be on the brink of wider-scale adoption and explosive growth in market capitalization. In this post, we contend that the driving factor is not their proximity to digital cash instruments, but rather how they are transferred—via global, open-access, peer-to-peer systems, or “permissionless blockchains,” for short.",T6
351,"There has been a lot of interest in firms’ pricing decisions in the past few years—both during the inflation surge of 2021-23 and in the more recent rounds of tariff increases. In this post, we let firms speak for themselves about what factors they consider when adjusting prices in response to various shocks. The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T7

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T2
353,"In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/u-s-banks-have-developed-a-significant-nonbank-footprint"">previous post</a>, we documented how, over the past five decades, the typical U.S. bank has evolved from an entity mainly focused on deposit taking and loan making to a more diversified conglomerate also incorporating a variety of nonbank activities. In this post, we show that an important driver of the evolution of this new organizational form is the desire of banks to efficiently manage liquidity needs.<br />",T5
354,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T5
355,"In 2025, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, trade policy has shifted abruptly, and economic policy uncertainty has increased. How have these developments affected the functioning of the key U.S. Treasury securities market? In this post, we return to some familiar metrics to assess the recent behavior of Treasury market liquidity. We find that liquidity briefly worsened around the April 2025 tariff announcements but that its relation to Treasury volatility has been similar to what it was in the past.",T1
356,"Bank failures and distress can be costly to the economy, causing losses to creditors and reducing the flow of credit and other financial intermediation services. Thus, there is significant value in being able to identify “at risk” banks in a timely and accurate way.

In this post, we continue to draw on our recent <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1144.html"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Staff Report</a> to present analysis showing that Economic Capital identifies failing banks earlier and more accurately than more conventional solvency measures.",T5

358,"After the Great Financial Crisis, the European Central Bank (ECB) extended its monetary policy toolbox to include the use of long-term loans to banks at interest rates close to zero or even negative.

However, quantitative evidence on the effects of these interventions on financial stability remains scant.
