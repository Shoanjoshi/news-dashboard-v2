320,"Inflation does not always respond to cost and demand pressures in the same way. When shocks are small, the mapping from costs to prices is roughly proportional—double the shock, double the inflation response. But when the economy is hit by large shocks, this proportionality breaks down. As the recent surge and subsequent decline of global inflation showed, price growth can accelerate—or decelerate—by more than one-for-one relative to the size of the disturbance. Economists refer to this pattern as nonlinear inflation dynamics. In this post, I discuss what these nonlinearities mean, how they relate to the slope of the Phillips curve discussed in a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/02/anatomy-not-autopsy-of-the-phillips-curve"">companion post</a>, and how firm-level data can help us understand the mechanisms behind them.",T6
321,"The relationship between inflation and real economic activity has long been central to debates in macroeconomics and monetary policy. At the core of this debate is the Phillips curve (PC), which measures how strongly inflation reacts to movements in economic conditions. The steepness of this curve matters enormously for monetary policy: if the PC is steeper, inflation rises faster during booms and falls faster in recessions, which entails central banks having to act more forcefully if they want to stabilize inflation around their target. Prior analysis found astonishingly small estimates of the slope of the PC, which suggests that the curve is “flat” (or even dead). In this post, I present evidence from coauthored research showing that, contrary to the conventional view, the Phillips curve is alive and steep, and it captures inflation volatility remarkably well once real marginal cost is used instead of standard real economic activity measures.",T6

324,"It is common for price measures to consider changes in quality. That is, a price index might fall even though listed prices are unchanged because the quality of the item has improved. An adjustment for quality captures the fact that consumers are effectively getting more for the same dollar when product quality rises. In practice, however, it is notoriously difficult to measure quality changes since it requires access to detailed data on all product characteristics that matter to consumers. We offer a novel method to infer quality changes and apply it to U.S. import price indices. When we account for quality improvements in this way, we find that the import price inflation based on official measures has been overstated, revealing that consumers have been getting more from their purchases of imported goods than what standard quality adjustments suggest.",T3

Despite these patterns, we found that the labor force participation of workers with disabilities rose noticeably following the pandemic. A relevant question then is how earnings of workers with disabilities compare with workers without disabilities. In this companion post we investigate differences in weekly earnings for workers with and without disabilities. We find that workers with disabilities earn considerably less than workers without disabilities. Additionally, with few exceptions, their earnings have remained roughly constant in real terms since the pre-pandemic period.",T8
326,"Among people in prime working age (25-54), around 7 percent have a disability of some kind. In this set of companion posts, we will examine how prime-aged workers with disabilities have fared in the labor market compared to the year prior to the pandemic. In this first post, we will show that people with disabilities are far less likely to be employed than people without disabilities, with both lower labor force participation and higher unemployment playing a role. We will also show that although employment rates of people with disabilities are very low, they have risen rapidly during the post-pandemic period, largely because of rising labor force participation. Our results are consistent with an increased prevalence of work from home (WFH) arrangements in the post-COVID period differentially benefiting people with disabilities.",T8

328,"The European Union has been an early adopter of carbon policies, with the introduction of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in 2005. This scheme sets a common price for carbon and is applied to the most polluting manufacturing sectors. By increasing the cost of emissions-intensive production, the system incentivizes firms to decrease their use of fossil fuels. However, as we show in a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-can-undermine-a-carbon-tax/"">companion post</a>, the policy’s impact was moderated by firms increasing their reliance on high-emissions imports. To eliminate this workaround, the EU will expand the ETS to imports in 2026, through the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CBAM will essentially put a tariff on imported goods based on their carbon content. Our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a> provides a quantitative analysis of how the ETS and CBAM affect firms’ supply choice decisions, and the resulting changes in domestic prices and emissions.<br />",T3
329,"Several countries have implemented a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to establish high carbon prices and create a disincentive for the use of fossil fuels. Essentially, the tax encourages firms to substitute toward low carbon emission energy. Costs also rise for firms down the supply chain that use production inputs with high-emission content, so the total impact of a carbon tax can be large. In practice, however, firms also have an incentive to find an offset to a carbon tax. In this post, based on our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a>, we present evidence of one such adaptation strategy. We show that French firms increased their imports of high-emission inputs from suppliers outside the European Union’s cap-and-trade system, known as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), reducing the effectiveness of this approach to cutting carbon emissions—an adaptation strategy that leads to “carbon leakage.” To help stop this leakage, the EU is implementing a ""carbon tariff"" in 2026, which is the topic of a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-is-a-carbon-tariff-and-why-is-the-eu-imposing-one/"">companion po",T3

Our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1155.html"">recent Staff Report</a> combines insights from academic research in economics, finance, and accounting to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges involved in designing and implementing bank regulation, as well as opportunities for future exploration. This post focuses on the regulation of bank capital, but the ideas are applicable more broadly.",T11
335,"This post presents an update of the economic forecasts generated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. We describe very briefly our forecast and its change since <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/09/the-new-york-fed-dsge-model-forecast-september-2025/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">September 2025</a>. To summarize, growth in 2025 is expected to be stronger than in September due to a lower projected path of the policy rate, as well as higher productivity. Inflation projections are higher in 2025 because of cost-push shocks, which capture the effects of tariffs. The model’s predictions for the short-run real natural rate of interest (or r*) in 2025 have decreased relative to September.",T6

337,"There has been a lot of interest in firms’ pricing decisions in the past few years—both during the inflation surge of 2021-23 and in the more recent rounds of tariff increases. In this post, we let firms speak for themselves about what factors they consider when adjusting prices in response to various shocks. The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T6

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T6

376,"<p>※この記事は自動翻訳されています。正確な内容につきましては原文をご参照ください。 要点 パンデミック初期に台頭した中国語話者向けマネーロンダリングネットワーク（Chinese Money Laundering Network: CMLN）は、現在では既知の暗号資産マネーロンダリングの中心的な担い手となっており、過去5年間に不正な暗号資産資金のおよそ20％を処理したと推計されます。このCMLNへの流入の伸びは、2020年以降の中央集権型取引所への不正流入の伸びと比べて7,325倍のスピードです。 CMLNは2025年に161億ドルを処理しており、1,799以上のアクティブウォレットで1日あたり約4,400万ドルに相当します。 Chainalysisは、CMLNエコシステムの中に6種類の明確に異なるサービス形態が存在し、それぞれに固有のオンチェーン上の行動パターンがあることを特定しました。Black Uやギャンブル系サービスは、大口トランザクションを複数の少額に分割して検知を回避する一方、相対取引型（Over-the-Counter、OTC）サービスは少額トランザクションをまとめて大口に集約し、資金を統合します。 HuioneやXinbiのような担保プラットフォームは、マネーロンダリング業者が集まるハブとして機能しますが、基盤となる取引活動自体を管理しているわけではないため、本分析の集計指標には含めていません。法執行機関による取締りは一定の打撃を与えてきたものの、業者は別のチャネルへと移動するだけであることが多く、洗浄オペレーター本人を直接的に狙う必要性が浮き彫りになっています。 不正なオンチェーンのマネーロンダリングエコシステムは、ここ数年で劇的に拡大しており、2020年の100億ドルから2025年には820億ドル超へと増加しました。[1] この大幅な総額の伸びは、暗号資産へのアクセス性と流動性の高まりに加え、マネーロンダリングがどのような手口で、誰によって行われているかという点で、構造的な変化が起きていることを反映しています。 下のチャートが示すとおり、中国語話者向けマネーロンダリングネットワーク（CMLN）は、既知の不正なマネーロンダリング活動に占める割合を2025年には約20％まで高めています。この地域的な結び付きは、当社が観測するオフランプ（暗号資産から法定通貨などへの出口）のパターンからも裏付けられます。例えば、本レポートの詐欺に関する章で述べたように、CLMNは現在、pig butchering（ロマンス詐欺）スキームで盗まれた資金の1割超を継続的に洗浄するまでに拡大しており、同時に中央集権型取引所の利用が一貫して減少しています。これは、取引所が資金を凍結できることが一因と考えられます。 他のマネーロンダリング先と比較すると、2020年以降、",T0
