324,"It is common for price measures to consider changes in quality. That is, a price index might fall even though listed prices are unchanged because the quality of the item has improved. An adjustment for quality captures the fact that consumers are effectively getting more for the same dollar when product quality rises. In practice, however, it is notoriously difficult to measure quality changes since it requires access to detailed data on all product characteristics that matter to consumers. We offer a novel method to infer quality changes and apply it to U.S. import price indices. When we account for quality improvements in this way, we find that the import price inflation based on official measures has been overstated, revealing that consumers have been getting more from their purchases of imported goods than what standard quality adjustments suggest.",T6

Despite these patterns, we found that the labor force participation of workers with disabilities rose noticeably following the pandemic. A relevant question then is how earnings of workers with disabilities compare with workers without disabilities. In this companion post we investigate differences in weekly earnings for workers with and without disabilities. We find that workers with disabilities earn considerably less than workers without disabilities. Additionally, with few exceptions, their earnings have remained roughly constant in real terms since the pre-pandemic period.",T0

We will also show that although employment rates of people with disabilities are very low, they have risen rapidly during the post-pandemic period, largely because of rising labor force participation. Our results are consistent with an increased prevalence of work from home (WFH) arrangements in the post-COVID period differentially benefiting people with disabilities.",T0

328,"The European Union has been an early adopter of carbon policies, with the introduction of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in 2005. This scheme sets a common price for carbon and is applied to the most polluting manufacturing sectors. By increasing the cost of emissions-intensive production, the system incentivizes firms to decrease their use of fossil fuels. However, as we show in a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-can-undermine-a-carbon-tax/"">companion post</a>, the policy’s impact was moderated by firms increasing their reliance on high-emissions imports. To eliminate this workaround, the EU will expand the ETS to imports in 2026, through the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CBAM will essentially put a tariff on imported goods based on their carbon content. Our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a> provides a quantitative analysis of how the ETS and CBAM affect firms’ supply choice decisions, and the resulting changes in domestic prices and emissions.<br />",T9
329,"Several countries have implemented a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to establish high carbon prices and create a disincentive for the use of fossil fuels. Essentially, the tax encourages firms to substitute toward low carbon emission energy. Costs also rise for firms down the supply chain that use production inputs with high-emission content, so the total impact of a carbon tax can be large. In practice, however, firms also have an incentive to find an offset to a carbon tax. In this post, based on our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a>, we present evidence of one such adaptation strategy. We show that French firms increased their imports of high-emission inputs from suppliers outside the European Union’s cap-and-trade system, known as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), reducing the effectiveness of this approach to cutting carbon emissions—an adaptation strategy that leads to “carbon leakage.” To help stop this leakage, the EU is implementing a ""carbon tariff"" in 2026, which is the topic of a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-is-a-carbon-tariff-and-why-is-the-eu-imposing-one/"">companion po",T9

337,"There has been a lot of interest in firms’ pricing decisions in the past few years—both during the inflation surge of 2021-23 and in the more recent rounds of tariff increases. In this post, we let firms speak for themselves about what factors they consider when adjusting prices in response to various shocks. The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T6
338,"A <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/10/is-us-monetary-policy-seasonal/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">2012 <em>Liberty Street Economics</em> post</a> noted that U.S. monetary policy exhibits a surprising degree of seasonal behavior: over the 1987-2008 period, the Federal Reserve was much more likely to lower interest rates (or abstain from raising rates) in the first month of each quarter than in the two subsequent months. Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes. We find that the pattern has indeed continued; however, unlike in the earlier sample period, it can be completely explained by the timing of the FOMC calendar.",T0
339,"In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/u-s-banks-have-developed-a-significant-nonbank-footprint"">previous post</a>, we documented how, over the past five decades, the typical U.S. bank has evolved from an entity mainly focused on deposit taking and loan making to a more diversified conglomerate also incorporating a variety of nonbank activities. In this post, we show that an important driver of the evolution of this new organizational form is the desire of banks to efficiently manage liquidity needs.<br />",T12
340,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T12
341,"In 2025, the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, trade policy has shifted abruptly, and economic policy uncertainty has increased. How have these developments affected the functioning of the key U.S. Treasury securities market? In this post, we return to some familiar metrics to assess the recent behavior of Treasury market liquidity. We find that liquidity briefly worsened around the April 2025 tariff announcements but that its relation to Treasury volatility has been similar to what it was in the past.",T6
342,"Bank failures and distress can be costly to the economy, causing losses to creditors and reducing the flow of credit and other financial intermediation services. Thus, there is significant value in being able to identify “at risk” banks in a timely and accurate way. In a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/09/economic-capital-a-new-measure-of-bank-solvency/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">previous post</a>, we presented a new solvency metric, Economic Capital, and showed how solvency risks in the U.S. banking industry have evolved over time according to this measure.

382,"<p>※この記事は自動翻訳されています。正確な内容につきましては原文をご参照ください。 要約 2025年、暗号資産詐欺および不正による被害額は推定170億ドルとなりました。なりすまし詐欺は前年比1,400%の急増を示し、AIを活用した詐欺は従来型の詐欺と比べて約4.5倍の利益をあげています。 大規模な詐欺組織はさらに産業化が進み、フィッシング・アズ・ア・サービス、AI生成ディープフェイク、プロのマネーロンダリングネットワークといった高度なインフラを構築しました。 カンボジアやミャンマーなどの強制労働施設を中心に、東南アジア犯罪ネットワークとの強力な結びつきが確認されており、被害者が詐欺の実行を強要されている事例も多数見つかっています。 法執行機関による過去最大規模の押収が実現し、英国での61,000ビットコイン回収やPrince Group犯罪組織に関連する150億ドルの資産差押えも行われ、暗号資産詐欺対策の能力向上が示されました。 2025年、暗号資産詐欺はオンチェーンベースで少なくとも140億ドルを受領し、2024年に最初に報告した99億ドル（執筆時点で再計算12億ドル）から大きく増加しました。これは当初の2024年予測（124億ドル）とほぼ一致しています。過去の傾向から、年次推計は報告間で平均24%増加しているため、今後さらに多くの不正ウォレットアドレスが特定されるにつれ、2025年の被害額は170億ドル超に達すると見込まれます。 今年のデータからは、詐欺師が手法を巧妙化し続けていることが明らかとなり、1件あたりの平均詐欺送金額は2024年の782ドルから2025年には2,764ドルへと253%増加しました。全体の詐欺流入も大きく増加しており、特になりすまし手法は前年比1,400%という驚異的な伸びを示しています。高利回り投資プログラム（HYIP）やロマンス詐欺（Pig Butchering）が依然として主要カテゴリですが、AIの活用、高度なSMSフィッシングサービス、複雑なマネーロンダリングネットワークを組み合わせることで、被害者をこれまで以上に効率的に標的とする手口の融合が見られます。 詐欺の従来型分類は曖昧になりつつあり、複数の手法（なりすまし、ソーシャルエンジニアリング、技術系・ウォレット系詐欺）が組み合わさるケースが増加しています。 なりすまし詐欺が爆発的に増加 なりすまし詐欺は特に懸念されるトレンドとなっており、2024年比で1,400%以上増加、これらのクラスタへの平均送金額も600%以上増加しました。この手法では、詐欺師が正規組織や権威者になりすまし、被害者をだまして送金させます。 政府なりすまし：E-ZPass詐欺ネットワーク 政府なりすましは、公式連絡への信頼を利用した非常に効果的な手口となっています。2025年には、米国のE-ZP",T6
