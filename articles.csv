Despite these patterns, we found that the labor force participation of workers with disabilities rose noticeably following the pandemic. A relevant question then is how earnings of workers with disabilities compare with workers without disabilities. In this companion post we investigate differences in weekly earnings for workers with and without disabilities. We find that workers with disabilities earn considerably less than workers without disabilities. Additionally, with few exceptions, their earnings have remained roughly constant in real terms since the pre-pandemic period.",T10

We will also show that although employment rates of people with disabilities are very low, they have risen rapidly during the post-pandemic period, largely because of rising labor force participation. Our results are consistent with an increased prevalence of work from home (WFH) arrangements in the post-COVID period differentially benefiting people with disabilities.",T10

335,"The European Union has been an early adopter of carbon policies, with the introduction of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in 2005. This scheme sets a common price for carbon and is applied to the most polluting manufacturing sectors. By increasing the cost of emissions-intensive production, the system incentivizes firms to decrease their use of fossil fuels. However, as we show in a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-can-undermine-a-carbon-tax/"">companion post</a>, the policy’s impact was moderated by firms increasing their reliance on high-emissions imports. To eliminate this workaround, the EU will expand the ETS to imports in 2026, through the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CBAM will essentially put a tariff on imported goods based on their carbon content. Our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a> provides a quantitative analysis of how the ETS and CBAM affect firms’ supply choice decisions, and the resulting changes in domestic prices and emissions.<br />",T3
336,"Several countries have implemented a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system to establish high carbon prices and create a disincentive for the use of fossil fuels. Essentially, the tax encourages firms to substitute toward low carbon emission energy. Costs also rise for firms down the supply chain that use production inputs with high-emission content, so the total impact of a carbon tax can be large. In practice, however, firms also have an incentive to find an offset to a carbon tax. In this post, based on our <a href=""https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1136"">recent work</a>, we present evidence of one such adaptation strategy. We show that French firms increased their imports of high-emission inputs from suppliers outside the European Union’s cap-and-trade system, known as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), reducing the effectiveness of this approach to cutting carbon emissions—an adaptation strategy that leads to “carbon leakage.” To help stop this leakage, the EU is implementing a ""carbon tariff"" in 2026, which is the topic of a <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2026/01/what-is-a-carbon-tariff-and-why-is-the-eu-imposing-one/"">companion po",T3

344,"There has been a lot of interest in firms’ pricing decisions in the past few years—both during the inflation surge of 2021-23 and in the more recent rounds of tariff increases. In this post, we let firms speak for themselves about what factors they consider when adjusting prices in response to various shocks. The analysis is based on an ongoing research project, joint with the Atlanta and Cleveland Federal Reserve Banks, on how businesses set prices and the extent of passthrough of cost increases. In particular, we leverage the qualitative portion of the study based on open-ended interviews with senior decision-makers on how they approach pricing decisions in their firms. Rather than a uniform approach, a very nuanced picture emerges of businesses trying to balance competing objectives while keeping an eye on demand conditions for their products as well as on their direct competitors’ behavior in the market.",T8

Thirteen years later, we revisit that analysis to investigate whether the seasonal pattern in monetary policy still holds today, in the wake of a rate hiking cycle, a pandemic, a surge in inflation, and a second round of rate hikes.

347,"<br />In light of the rapid growth of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), many have argued that bank-led financial intermediation is on the decline, based on the traditional notion that banks operate to take in deposits and make loans. However, we argue that deposit-taking and loan-making have not accurately characterized U.S. banking operations in recent decades. Instead, as we propose in this post, absent regulatory restrictions, banks naturally expand their boundaries to include NBFI subsidiaries. A significant component of the growth of NBFIs has in fact taken place <em>inside </em>the boundaries of banking firms.",T6

389,"<p>※この記事は自動翻訳されています。正確な内容につきましては原文をご参照ください。 要約 北朝鮮のハッカーが2025年に暗号資産を20.2億ドル盗み、前年比51%増加、累計被害総額は67.5億ドルに到達。攻撃件数は減少傾向。 北朝鮮は、IT労働者を暗号資産サービス内部に配置したり、経営層を標的とした高度ななりすまし手法を用いるなど、少ない件数で巨額の盗難を実現している。 北朝鮮は、中国語系のマネーロンダリングサービスやブリッジサービス、ミキシングプロトコルを好んで利用し、大規模な窃盗後は約45日間で資金洗浄を完了させる傾向がある。 2025年、個人ウォレットの侵害は15万8,000件に急増し、被害者は8万人に達したが、被害総額（7億1,300万ドル）は2024年から減少した。 分散型金融（DeFi）における預かり資産（TVL）は増加したが、2024～2025年のハッキング被害額は抑制されており、セキュリティ対策の強化が効果を発揮している可能性が示唆される。 暗号資産エコシステムは2025年も厳しい1年となり、盗難被害額は増加傾向が続きました。当社の分析からは、暗号資産盗難のパターンが変化していることが明らかになり、主な変化は以下の4点です。北朝鮮（DPRK）が依然として最大の脅威であること、中央集権型サービスへの個別攻撃が深刻化していること、個人ウォレットの被害が急増していること、そして分散型金融（DeFi）ハッキングのトレンドが従来と異なる動きを見せていることです。 これらの傾向はデータから明確に読み取れ、さまざまなプラットフォームや被害者層で暗号資産盗難の様相が大きく変化していることが分かります。デジタルアセットの普及が進み、資産価値が新たな高みに到達する中で、進化するセキュリティ脅威を理解することがますます重要となっています。 全体像：2025年に34億ドル以上が盗難被害 2025年1月から12月初旬までの間に、暗号資産業界では34億ドル超の盗難被害が発生しました。そのうち、2月のBybitへの攻撃だけで15億ドルを占めています。 この総額の背後では、盗難の構成にも重要な変化が見られます。個人ウォレットの侵害による被害割合は大きく増加し、2022年の全体の7.3％から2024年には44％に拡大。2025年はBybit事件の影響が大きくなければ37％になっていたと考えられます。 一方で、中央集権型サービスでは、秘密鍵インフラや署名プロセスを狙った高度な攻撃により、損失規模がますます拡大しています。機関としての豊富なリソースや専門のセキュリティチームを擁しているにもかかわらず、これらのプラットフォームは依然として、コールドウォレットの制御をすり抜ける高度な脅威に対して脆弱なままです。こうした侵害は（下図が示すとおり）発生頻度こそ低いものの、一度起きると",T3
